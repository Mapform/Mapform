# Mapform

## Current state

- Reverse geocoding disabled (not included in free tier of Stadia)
- AI enabled via Vercel AI Gateway
- Stripe is wired-up, but users unable to pick pro plans
- Mapform domain expiring in summer 2026. At this point I should just down the project (magic links won't work anymore). I can open source it instead.
